## Logec Attack Documentation



## Understanding the code:

There are 2 major prefixes which will help clear some confusion up with client/server interations
If the function, or variable is on, or meant for the server, it will have  a 's_' infront of it
If it is meant for the client, a "c_" will be apart of it.

I have tried my best to make these as readable as possible, for example: c_get_hostname() - replace the c_ with the
word 'client', and it reads 'client get hostname', The other way around: s_action - reads 'server action'

in some cases, Target is interchanged for client, to avoid some namespace clashing (this is mostly in the Module files)
